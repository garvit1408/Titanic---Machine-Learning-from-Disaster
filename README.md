# 🚢 Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository presents a full data science workflow for the **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** competition on Kaggle. The project includes exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and the development of machine learning models to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To build a predictive model that determines whether a given passenger survived, based on features such as age, gender, passenger class, and family relationships.

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (`titanic_eda_colab.ipynb`)
- Inspection of dataset structure and missing values  
- Visual exploration of survival patterns across demographic groups  
- Feature correlation and distribution analysis

### 2. Machine Learning Modeling (`titanic_modeling_kaggle.ipynb`)
- Data preprocessing (handling missing data, encoding categorical features)  
- Feature selection and transformation  
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Model evaluation and prediction generation for submission
